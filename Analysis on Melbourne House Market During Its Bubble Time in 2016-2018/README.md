# Melbourne House Analysis & Takeaways

Melbourne was experiencing a housing bubble around 2016 â€“ 2018 (some experts say it might even burst). In this notebook I tried to find what an investor need to do during this time. These are some of my conclusions :

1.	The most important factor that contributes to the price of a house are its distance to the city center and its building area.
2.	The price of the house always decline around January and February.
3.	If you are looking for a cheap house located close to Melbourne City Business District, Western Metropolitan is the cheapest region. But if you are really looking for the cheapest house in Melbourne and doesn't really care about its distance to CBD, then Western Victoria is the place for you my friend.
