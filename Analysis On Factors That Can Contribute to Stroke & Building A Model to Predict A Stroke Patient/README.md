# Stroke-Patients-Analysis

This is a project about stroke patients. What we have here in this data is information such as age, body mass index, average glucose level, etc. In this data, there are also data from non-stroke patients, so we can compare all this information to find out what factors that contribute the most to stroke. 

Not only making an exploratory data analysis to find out what factor contribute the most, we also build and compare machine learning models and determine which model is the best for this problem, which is predicting whether a patient having stroke or not based on the information that they have.
